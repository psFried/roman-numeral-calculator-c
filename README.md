Roman Numeral Calculator 
========================

An implementation of the roman numeral calculator kata found [here](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanCalculator). Uses [libcheck](https://libcheck.github.io/check/) for unit testing.

I tried to commit more frequently than I normally would in order to show the process a bit better. 

## Building

This is building inside a docker container, so you don't have to worry about any of the dependencies. Just requires Docker.

To build and run tests: `./build.sh`

To get into the container so you can play around with things directly: `./container.sh`
